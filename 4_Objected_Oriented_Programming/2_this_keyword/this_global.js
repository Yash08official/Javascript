// This keyword we learn

// When you say 
console.log(this);
// You are writing this line in a global scope , so this keyword in global scope always points global object
// In browser it is window object and in node.js it is global object

// What is this window object :
// this is a global object which is present inside the browser

// So whenever you run a file , global execution context gets created we know it very well
// So when you run a file , global execution context gets created and this keyword points to global object
// so , in the browser the global object is "Window"

// And if you type "this" in the browser it will gives window

// So , this keyword is always pointing to global object in global scope
// this ==> window
// this ==> global object
// "this == window"  the browser gives you true
// we will see what is the value of this inside the function
