// Nodes and relationship in the DOM

// DOM tree looks, where you have a document object at the top and inside this document object, you have the other elements
//,other nodes of the tree
// Every tag you give in the html document it becomes node
// we know hat our html document starts from HTML tag, so this HTML tag is a root element
// It is the root element of the document object model
// So inside the html,we have two child
// which are head and body , so this are called as elements and if we are write anything inside it
// which are called text node
