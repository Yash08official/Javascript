<h1>Javascript Identifiers</h1>

We understood how we can declare the varible in Javascript , now each variables we have to give a unique name to that variable

let say we have declare the variable as :

let x = 12;

that "x" is called as the identifier and when we declare the same name like

const x = 13;

we got an error beacuse every identifier should be unique

the four things which can easily put in the varible names :: letter , number, underscore,dillar

the variable name shoud only start with letter, underscore, dillar that means it cannot start with numbers
