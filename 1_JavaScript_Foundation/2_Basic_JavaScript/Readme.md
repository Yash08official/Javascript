<h1>Basic Syntax Javascript </h1>

It helps us to build web applications
It helps us to build dynamic and interactive web applications
It intially introduced as the client side language, means intially we were only able to run javascript on browsers but later on it moves out of the browsers also and we were able to execute javascript outside also . This is made this language as a full stack language

There are three ways to execute javascript

1. Directly execute javascript on browsers
   Because the browsers having a particular javascript engine running inside it and compiling the code and the code understood by the machine with the help of the complier with the help of the engine which is running inside my browsers
2. Node js was introduced to run javascript outside the browsers

"NODE JS : It is a Open source, cross platform Javascript runtime Environment"

We download the node js

"To check the node js is installed you need to type node -v : It gives me the version of the node js installed"

Now lets create on folder and then file

"Console" is an API which is presented to javascript by browsers and ".log" in a finction

To run the file go to terminal and inside this terminal and write "node file_name" like node index.js

Code is running

3. we can directly run the js code in the browsers using HTML files

Lets create one html file as index.html
Then we create a boiler plate code

Just putting some code in it

After writing and linking the file open the live server

after that go to inspect the console "first code in js" this will written there the console code

This are the ways to write Javascript code
