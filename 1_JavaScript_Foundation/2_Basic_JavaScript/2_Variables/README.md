<h1>Variables in Javascript </h1>

It is like a named container or label in javascript that holds informations

It helps you keep things organized and easilly accessible

<ul> <li> Varibles are the containers for storing data</li>
<br>
Lets see how we can use it javascript

We can directly declare variables , we have to give a variable name
lets say my varaible name is X and the value 10

"x=10;"

we can simply write console.log(x)

Console.log.(x);

so this will print

and we can run this file using node and \_fileName.js

In this we are not declare this variable this will automatically declared

But in JAVASCRIPT we can declare variables using "VAR", "LET","CONST" keywords

<h3>Keywords :</h3>

var x =15;

let u = 20;

const r = 12;


<h2>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "VAR", "LET", "CONST"</h2>;

When you declare any variable using "Var" keyword  it was used intaolly from 1995 when javascript was introduced in 2015 then in 2015 some major changes occur then we got "let" which was used in ECMAScript six and we also got "Const". from now onwards we should not used "Var" we should only used var to declare variables for the older browsers but we always used "Let" & "Const"

"Let ": is "block" scope and 
"var" : is Global Scope

when we declare any variable using const we shoud not declare it further it will be constant
