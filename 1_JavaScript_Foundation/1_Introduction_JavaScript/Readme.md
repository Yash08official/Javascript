<h1> Introduction to Programming </h1>

<h2>A: Problem Solving </h2>

Suppose you have a problem and you need to find the solution of this problem So what you will take one by one to solve this problem . That is problem solving
Basically : "Finding a solution to a problem"

Imagine you have a puzzle and you need to put all of this pieces together, So how you will put all of this pieces together. Problem solving is something like that where you try to figure out something a solution which is, which can be really challenging or puzzling

Problem solving is finding a solution to any problem you have and that problem can be challenging also

<ul> 
  <li> Identify the problem</li>
  <li> Break down problem into smaller pieces</li>
  <li> Tackle each piece ine by one</li>
</ul>

Ex : You want to go to school and your bicycle has a flat tire, so how do you go to school ?
Either you will feel stuck
and you will not do anything about it
You either you will try to fin out a solution to your problem

So there can be multiple solution to this problem

<ul> 
  <li>Find a friend to give you a ride</li>
  <li>Borrow bike</li>
  <li>Learn how to fix that tire</li>
</ul>

If you do anyone you will easily get to school

"Its about thinking outside of the box, and how you just try to get to a solution by thinking and being creative and getting to the solution"

<h2>B: What is Programming</h2>

It is also a problem solving

When you write a code in a computer, you are basically providing a set of instructions to solve some complex tasks

It is a digital problem solver
Here to tell the computer how to naviagte
how to solve the complex tasks and produces the results which we want

It is basically providing instructions to computer to perform a specific tasks and it involves writing a set of instructions in a language which computer can understand and this set of instructions are called "CODE".

We have to get a solution to a problem through a computer and so we have to instruct the computer, we have provide some instructions to computer to get a solution to a problem

"PROGRAMMING is a art and science of giving instructions to a computer"
