<h1>JavaScript Operators</h1>

Operators are the symbols which are used to perform som computations

There are different types of operators :

<ul><li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Comparison Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Conditional Operators</li>
<li>Type Operators</li></ul>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators :</h2>

This are used to perform some Arithmetic operations on the variables . We perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentation (a \*\* b) : a to the power b, modulus(a % b) : When we divide two numbers , the remainder of the two number that is the modulus
Example : Addition ::-

let a =10;
let b = 20;
let addition = a+b;
console.log("addition :", addition);

"\_variableName++" ::- Post increment
"++\_variableName" ::- Pre increment

<h2>Assignment Operators :</h2>

let x = 10;

In this we assign value "10" to the variable "x" by using assignment operator "= (equals to)"
